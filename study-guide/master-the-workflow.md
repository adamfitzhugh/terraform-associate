# Master the Workflow

The core Terraform workflow has 3 steps:

1. Write - Author of the IaC
2. Plan - Preview changes before applying
3. Apply - Provision reproducible infrastructure


## Working as an Individual

### Write
- Repeatedly running plans against your work helps you flush out syntax errors and ensure your config is correct.

### Plan
- Because 'terraform apply' will display a plan of confirmation before proceeding, thats the command you run for final review.

### Apply
- Once your code is applied and working, it's common to push your version control repository to a remote location for safekeeping.
